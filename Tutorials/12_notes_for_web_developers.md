# Notes for Web Developers

1. If you're working on your personal project, please spend more time on **the content**.
  
   Programmers often spend a lot of time on design and code rather than content. But for browsers, what they need is information, and information comes from content.
2. If you can't design a good interface, at least deal with **alignment**, **font size**, and **readability** of content.
